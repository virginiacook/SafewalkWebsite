    <h1>Safewalk</h1>
    <h3>Have you ever felt unsafe walking the mean streets of New York City? Since New York is mostly based on a grid, wouldn't it be nice to know which path is optimal to travel along without even having to go out of the way? Safewalk is your solution! Safewalk's Manhattan Beta calculates three different paths for you to get to your destination in the safest way possible by incorporating not only the distance of each block, but also the number of crimes along that block. It also searches for restaurants currently open in case the path still does not feel safe and you would like to enter a safe zone. You can also give feedback about the different routes that will be incorporated into later versions of the app, so you can help others get around in a safer, smarter way too.
    </h3>
